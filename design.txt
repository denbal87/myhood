9/16/15 to do:


* automatically select a tag when select to show posts
	under a specific tag so you can post a question with 
	the tag already selected. 

* add answers to posts in search results + let users answer those posts? (have to get post id--might be hard?)


* make only the first n answers appear

* Map all neighborhoods (at least in MH)

* Main Menu:

	-Change Neighborhood:
		finish the dropdown button

* Neighborhood map--maybe one that shows what neighborhood the user is in
	by highlighting the borders; can have a different image for each neighborhood.	

* Change front page: 
	- add "locating your hood" message--how??
