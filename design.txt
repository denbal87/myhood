8/12/15 to do:

* Main Menu:

	-Categories:
		(Clothes) or generic "help me find..." or "lookinf for..." with tags

	-Change Neighborhood:
		just a dropdown with all neighborhoods.

* Map all neighborhoods (at least in MH)

* Neighborhood map--maybe one that shows what neighborhood the user is in
	by highlighting the borders; can have a different image for each neighborhood.	

* Change front page: 
	- add "locating your hood" message--how??
