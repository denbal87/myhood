		load this nh's q/a		load highlights from diff neighborhoods
	(what about categories?) 	 OR load "pick a neighborhood page"
	
	Have generic map so can click on a nh and it will show on map
	
	
	IMPORTANT:
	new design: use mostly zipcodes due to lack of neighborhood database.
	in case zipcodes overlap in regards to neighborhoods, look up the 
	neighborhood value in JSON.
	
	Need to decide what neighborhoods to include, i.e. whether to use
	parent or children neighborhoods in certain cases.
	
	Neighborhoods:
	10031, 30, 37, 39, 32, 33, 40, 34, 27, 26
	Inwood
	Wash. Heights
	Hamilton Heights
	Manhattanville
	Morningside Heights
	Harlem
	East Harlem
	
	10025, 24, 23 
	Upper West Side:
		100 - 96: Park West Village
	74 - 60: Lincoln Towers = Lincoln Square:
		San Juan Hill
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	database:
	
	id | post text | post neighborhood | answer (yes/no)


	use module for home page nh selection if user choses to opt out for
	location
	
	for posting an answer:
		pass post text + answer text to the view function. then retrieve post text
		and search database for a post with that text. then add asnwer to that post.
