8/12/15 to do:

* Map all neighborhoods (at least in MH)

* Main Menu:

	-Change Neighborhood:
		finish the dropdown button

* Neighborhood map--maybe one that shows what neighborhood the user is in
	by highlighting the borders; can have a different image for each neighborhood.	

* Change front page: 
	- add "locating your hood" message--how??
	-add something like "explore the neighborhoods"

* add dates to posts so users can see what's relevant?
